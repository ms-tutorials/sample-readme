## Overall Project Description

- You own a pizza place and as a way of trying to widen your customer base, you decide to create a web application where your customers order different sizes of pizzas with one or more toppings. 

## User Stories:

- Choose the size of pizza I want e.g Small, Medium, Large.
- Choose what kind of crust I would like the pizza to have e.g Crispy, Stuffed, Gluten-free.
- Choose the topping(s) I want on my pizza.
- Place an order for my Pizza and see the total charge for it.
- Have an option to order as many pizzas as I want.
- Have an option to have the pizza delivered or not.  If delivered I want to be alerted how much the delivery charge will be.
- User should have option to set delivery location by being be prompted to enter where the delivery should be made and an alert saying "your order will be delivered to your location".
- See a checkout button that when clicked shows the total amount charged for the orders.
- On checkout, the application displays the ordersâ€™ summary together with the total amount charged.
